              is a project to address the challenge of malicious Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) on Ethereum as well as other information asymmetries in distributed systems. MEV refers to the value that searchers or validators can extract from users' transactions through practices like front-running. Shutter aims to protect users from exploitation by employing a distributed key generation mechanism, ensuring fair and secure transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

              Initially, Shutter DAO 0x36 is allocating about 42% of SHU for public distribution while reserving 58% in the DAO's fund, which is dedicated to future initiatives, airdrops, community incentives, and unforeseen requirements.

              The genesis allocations claiming smart contracts require activating the vesting schedule of the tokens, which allows you to delegate the voting power equal to the whole amount of tokens in the vesting schedule. This delegation effectively gives the delegate increased voting power in the number of the delegating addressâ€™s tokens. Delegation of voting power can be canceled at any point.
